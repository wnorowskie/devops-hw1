## Relevant Experiences 
I graduated from Vassar College in 2023 with a Bachelors degree in Computer Science. I was on the soccer team at Vassar and because of covid I had an extra year of eligibility. So when the coaches at College of Charleston reached out it was a no brainer! After my final college soccer season I rejoined the company I had previously interned with, ConstructConnect, and started off my professional career as an Associate Software Engineer. I originally started working on our internal document data pipeline, and then switched over to help the team powering the backend for our main search page. After less than a year with company I was promoted to SWE I.

As far as experience as it relates specifically for this class, I have gotten a lot of experience with deployments, dev ops, and the general software lifecycle management. I have written a lot of terraform code, created true CICD pipelines, prepared release plans, rollback plans, deployment checklists, managed cloud infrastructure, created detailed terraform modules (most notably for our Elasticsearch deployments)... all of the nitty gritty needed to maintain and release production code.

## Looking Ahead 
I am actually trying not to look ahead too much. I don't want to jump to a tech lead role or something like that anytime in the near future. Right now I really enjoy grinding out code, solving really difficult problems, doing whatever to get things done. I think one day I would eventually like to be a tech lead, with some level of autonomy over decision making as it relates to the software.

## Hopes for This Course
I was never formally taught anything about deployments, releases, or dev ops. My undergrad was a very theoretical computer science degree, so everything I have learned has been on the job, and through my own self education. So I am hoping to get a more formal background in these topics.

## Extras
Other than work and school most of my time is still spent on the soccer field. I am the Director of Operations for the College of Charleston Men's Soccer, and also spend some time helping out with SC Surf, a local youth organization.
